# Running HPMyRoom in Docker

Horrible hack that's not safe for life

This will expose your X over the network, which is a bad idea.


## Run it

Expose your X

```
socat TCP-LISTEN:6000,reuseaddr,fork UNIX-CONNECT:/tmp/.X11-unix/X0
```

Now run `paprefs`, goto the network tab and click `enable network access to local sound devices`

```
./start.sh ${CONTAINER}
```


## Troubleshooting

If a popup keeps coming up and going away whenever you click, spam the mosue over the button you want to click and click fast.  You'll get it eventually...
